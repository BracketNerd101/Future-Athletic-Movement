Mock sports league organization

This is an example website designed to show a masonary grid and sutble micro animations. I chose the bootstrap framework to work on my ability to custumize the code to my design. Simply put I wanted to make a cool website and have it not be obvious that bootsrap was used.

Design influence come from Nike, addidas and modern website layout.
